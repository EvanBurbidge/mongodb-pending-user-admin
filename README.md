# Mongodb Atlas Pending Users Manager

I started this project due to the lacking of search functionality within the mongodb atlas admin, too often was
I asked to help with a user confirmation only to have to click "load more" endlessy until I found that users email. So I built this, which will enable you to sync your pending users into a supabase db instance.
